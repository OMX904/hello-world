Hello humans

Tom here 

I like node.js and coffe script (that's what I am made of!).
I have had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to the tacos on earth

I am an ordinary person with a great person in computers and I would very much like to learn web development and programming. I believe if I can achieve this in my life time I will never complain in my grave.
